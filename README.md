# All Around Azure: A Developer's Guide to AI

This repository contains a set of Azure AI Fundamental sessions and follow on resources. 
* Each session has a powerpoint presentation, including video demos and also a train-the-trainer video showing the content creator delivering the session (an idea of how you could deliver it)
* Given many of us are now delivering content online only - we understand that sessions need to be shortened compared to in-person conferences. Each sessions content is 15 - 20 mins duration + 10- 15 mins of Q&A recommeneded
* We also have carefully chosen the follow on resources. Therefore all sessions have one single link at the end. If an attendee of your session is inspired this one next step is where to go. All resources point towards [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/) and [Microsoft Learn modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/).

# Content Overview

### Title: A Developer's Guide to AI

### Abstract: 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving innovative solutions across all industries but with machine learning (ML) applying a paradigm change to how we approach building products we are all exploring how to expand our skill sets and enhance our applications
Tailwind Traders is a retail company looking for support on how to benefit from applying AI across their business. In 'Developers Guide to AI’ we’ll show how Tailwind Traders have solved business challenges and implemented AI technologies.
In this learning path you will see a wide range of examples: dealing with different types of data (text, audio, image, unstructured), sharing best practices around unstructured search and conversational AI or taking your next step in learning more about machine learning theory with low code solutions.

## Session Code AIML10
**Session Title:** Introducing Computer Vision for Automation in Changing Times

**Session Abstract:** In an effort to protect the wellbeing and safety of all employees during the global pandemic and promote social distancing, Tailwind Traders needed to reconsider its staffing model.  This has presented a challenge; quarterly inventory counts are happening in 4 weeks time and a reduction in staff means a longer inventory count period. 
In this session you will learn how Computer Vision was harnessed to address this opportunity and enable inventory counts to occur quicker to aid workers using Azure Cognitive services vision capabilities

**Key technologies included:** Cognitive Services Computer Vision, ONNX, Unity

## Session Code AIML50
**Session Title:** Start Building Machine Learning Models Faster than You Think

**Session Abstract:** Tailwind Traders are finding it difficult to accurately predict they inventory at their many different retail stores. They want to introduce custom machine learning models to help, without changing their Software Development Life Cycle. How? They are exploring Azure Machine Learning Designer. 
In this session, you’ll learn the data science process that Tailwind Traders’ uses and get an introduction to Azure Machine Learning Designer. You’ll see how to find, import, and prepare data, select a machine learning algorithm, train and test the model, and deploy a complete model to an API. Get tips, best practices, and resources you and your development team need to continue your machine learning journey.
